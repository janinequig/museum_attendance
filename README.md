### Purpose

The goal of this research is to determine the demographic and social factors that affect museum attendance. Furthermore, I intend to determine the degree and direction of these factors. My two research questions are as follows:
R.Q. 1: What are the factors that affect art museum/gallery attendance?
R.Q. 2: What is the strength and direction of these factors?

### Data

To complete this analysis, I will be using data provided by the Survey of Public Participation in the Arts, also called SPPA. The SPPA is conducted every five years by the National Archives of Data on Art & Culture (NADAC). You can find the data at the link below.

### Code

To move forward with analysis, I expect to use linear and logistic regression, along with correlation tests. Additionally, I will use variable selection and classificaiton/clustering models.

### Findings
